	<b>Testimonial 1</b> <br>
<br>
Dr. Park's treatment is effective, holistic and non invasive. I have been having a series of health issues.  <br>To mention a few, head, arms and legs numbness, menstrual disorder, skin rash, shoulder pain.  Over the <br>years, I've tried conventional treatment, but nothing worked.  In fact, taking prescribed medicine made <br>things worst.   So, gave up on seeing the doctors.  When Dr. Park's treatment came to my attention, I gave it <br>try, and I am glad I did.   Without the use of medicine, he helped balance my body and resolved some of <br>my health issues.  As he point out, health issues are the results of our daily eating habits and <br>activities, and so we need to correct them.  Many of us do not know that even some healthy food can be bad <br>for the body, if  they are not the proper food for your personal body system.  <br>
<br>
 I have been a vegetarian for over 20 years and have been very watchful of what I eat.  I believed that I <br>have been eating very healthily.  But in going through my eating diet with Dr. Park, he pointed out foods <br>that I should not eat even though to general knowledge, they might be super healthy foods.   The reason is <br>because they are not right for my personal body system.  It was enlightening to know this.  In adjusting <br>and changing my habits of food choice, along with doing my daily homework in stimulating the healing <br>points which he has point out, I see a great improvement in my health.  Dr. Park guided me through a process <br>of self treatment which can be applied for life.   I am glad that this type of treatment has come <br>forward and I am grateful that Dr. Park is conducting such research.  Many people will benefit from his <br>work.   <br>
<br>
 I would highly recommend his sessions, not just for those who are ill, but even for those who are healthy, <br>because it is preventative and curing.   Here I like to give my deepest respect and gratitude to Dr. <br>Park's work.<br>

I have been suffering from chronicle migraine, which extended to my jaw and left shoulder, for years. I have <br>consulted many physicians before with no avail. <br>
<br>
I have being diagnosed as having a high degree of hardening of my arteries under CT scan and a irregular <br>heart beats during treadmill test in 2007.<br>
<br>
I have also experienced occasional heart palpitation, which is quite fearful and bothersome, since the <br>beginning of this year.<br>

Shortly after receiving Dr. Park's treatment a little over a month ago, my migraine have been reduced <br>drastically in terms of its pain intensity as well its occurring frequency.  And, although it maybe too early <br>to tell, my palpitation hasn't recurred ever since.<br>
<br>
I am hoping Dr. Park's treatment (including the self administrated one) can help to prevent my heart problem <br>from becoming worse. From what I have experienced so far, I am very optimistic. <br>
<br>
Thank you very much Dr. Park.<br>

<b>Testimonial 3</b><br>
<br>
In December 2008, I had severe left flank pain and was diagnosed with unresectable germ cell tumor of the <br>left undescended testicle with massive lymph node involvement (Seminoma, TXN#M0S2, hCG<(0-10mIU/mL), AFP 3.82 <br>(0-10.5ng/mL), LDH 950 (200-400 IU/L). I received 4 cycles of chemotherapy (bleomycin, etopoisde and <br>cisppatin) and had an excision of residual mass including the undescended testicle and involved lymph nodes.<br><br>
<br>
From December 2008 to July 2009 I was in the hospital as an inpatient for couple months and became an <br>outpatient for last of month of my treatment. After the chemotherapy and surgery, my immune system became <br>extremely weak. I was constantly getting colds, including colds from my two year old son. These colds lasted <br>from 1 to 2 weeks at a time. It was impossible for doctors to remove the entire tumor because of its <br>massive involvement with lymph nodes.<br>
<br>
Dr. Park treated me with acupuncture to help boost my immune system. My immune system improved greatly in the <br>following years and the follow up CT/PET scans showed shrinking of the tumor. I am still undergoing hand <br>acupuncture to keep up with good health.           <br>
